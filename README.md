# COVID-Portfolio-Project---Data-Exploration-using-SQL

### Overview:

This project involves exploring COVID-19 data using SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). By leveraging SQL, we aim to analyze and gain insights from COVID-19 datasets, including cases, deaths, and vaccination statistics. The project provides a structured approach to data exploration, enabling users to extract valuable information and trends related to the pandemic.

### Features:

- Data exploration of COVID-19 datasets using SQL queries.
- Analysis of cases, deaths, and vaccination data.
- Visualization of key metrics using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or other visualization tools.
- Customizable queries for specific data analysis requirements.
- Integration with existing SQL Server databases for seamless data access.
- Dependencies:

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- SQL Server instance or database with COVID-19 datasets (e.g., cases, deaths, vaccination data)

### Installation:

Download and install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from Microsoft's official website.
Connect to your SQL Server instance or database containing the COVID-19 datasets.
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

### Usage:

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and connect to your SQL Server instance or database.
Navigate to the project directory and open the SQL script file (covid_data_exploration.sql) in SSMS.
Customize the SQL queries to explore specific aspects of the COVID-19 datasets, such as:
Total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
Daily new cases and deaths.
Regional or country-wise statistics.
Execute the SQL queries to retrieve and analyze the data from the COVID-19 datasets.
Optionally, visualize the key metrics using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or export the results to other visualization tools for further analysis and presentation.
